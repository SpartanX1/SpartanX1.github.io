Finding classic Bluetooth battery level using Windows UWP APIs and Sockets
==========================================================================

The Problem:
------------

Windows 10 (Build 18363) was not able to show the battery level of my Sony WH-CH510 bluetooth headphones. Although it showed up on my other laptop running an updated version of windows, I wanted to know if we could extract it via windows APIs.

Solution:
---------

I have detailed it in my github repo : [https://github.com/SpartanX1/bluetooth_classic_battery_windows](https://github.com/SpartanX1/bluetooth_classic_battery_windows)
